# Ecommerce Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Project Overview

In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an ecommerce dataset obtained from Kaggle. The goal of this project was to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns and relationships, and visualize the findings using various visualization libraries.
